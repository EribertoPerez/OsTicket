<h3>Intake</h3>
<p>
Users, Agents, or Admins can all create and submit tickets. In this example tickets are being submitted from a users' standpoint.

</p>
<br />

<h3>Assignment and Communication</h3>
<p>
After tickets are submitted, they can be viewed in the agent panel under the 'Tickets' tab. Here tickets are able to be viewed, assigned, updated, and resolved. It is normal for a company to have a dedicated agent who exclusively assignes tickets to the right departments or teams. It is visible in this example to see the ticket priority and whom the ticket is assigned to.

<h3>Working the Issue</h3>
<p>
After receiving tickets and sorting based on priority or direct order from management, a Help Desk Agent would begin resolving any urgent issues. Depending on company policy Users are updated on the issue regularly until the issue is resolved. Here we see a Help Desk agent communicate to a user the progress made on their issue.

</p>
<br />

<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>
Once a ticket is resolved a Help Desk Agent communicates the solution and then marks the ticket as 'resolved'. It can be good practice to go back to older resolved tickets to gain experience from previous Help Desk Agents. In this last example we can see a ticket being resolved.
