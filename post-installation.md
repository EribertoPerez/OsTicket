Create a new agent account by navigating to Agents and selecting 'Add New Agent' (Admin panel > Agents > Add New Agent). Here a few new Agents that were created and given

<h3>SLA (Service Level Agreements)</h3>
<p>
Create a new SLA plan by navigating to SLA and selecting 'Add New SLA Plan' (Admin panel > Manage > SLA > Add New SLA Plan). Here a few new SLA Plans that were created and have
differing grace periods and schedules. The purpose of the SLA Plan or Service Level Agreement is to provide a length of time in which the help desk Administrator expects tickets to be closed, but SLA plans can be different and mean different things from company to company.

<h3>Help Topics</h3>
<p>
Create new Help Topics by navigating to Help Topics and selecting 'Add New Help Topic' (Admin panel > Manage > Help Topics > Add New Help Topic). Here a few new Help Topics
that were created. The purpose of Help Topics are to help streamline your end-userâ€™s help desk experience to ensure proper assignment and prompt response to the ticket. Create as many Help Topics as needed and can even nest Help Topics within each other for further breakdown (For example, Human Resources and Human Resources/Payroll.).
